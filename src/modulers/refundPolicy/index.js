                    All payments for access to Courses are final and non-refundable, except as expressly provided in this policy. Once access to Course content has been granted, no refunds will be issued based solely on change of mind, inability to complete the Course, or dissatisfaction with
                    learning outcomes.

                    <li>The request must clearly state a valid reason and supporting documentation if required.
                    </li>
                    <li>Eligibility will be assessed on a case-by-case basis at our sole discretion.

                    To qualify for a refund consideration:

                <ul>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                    We may offer refunds or alternative solutions in exceptional cases such as:

                <p>
                    Even in such cases, refunds may be issued as credits toward future Courses or services rather than
                    direct monetary reimbursement.
